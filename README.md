# BSDE_test

# Methods for solving BSDE / PDE associated
# Features (still in work)

- Explicit and implicit method for one dimensional case ( problems to estimate d-dimensional conditional expectations )
- PDE resolution through marked branching diffusions monte carlo method ( still at work :'o  )
